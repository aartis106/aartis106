Hi, I'm @aartis106

👀 I'm interested in building scalable and efficient full-stack applications using Java, Spring Boot, and modern front-end technologies like React and Angular.

🌱 I'm currently learning about cloud-native applications, containerization using Docker, and Kubernetes for deployment and management.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that involve building complex systems, improving performance, and ensuring high availability. If you have a project that aligns with my interests, let's work together!

⚡ Fun fact: I'm a coffee aficionado and love trying out new coffee blends while coding! ☕️
